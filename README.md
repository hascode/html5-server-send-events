# HTML5 Server Send Events using Node.js or Jetty

A short example for the W3C working draft implementation on server side events.

You're able to run the examples using *node.js* or *Maven* with Jetty:

## Node.js

Simply run the following command:

    node server.js

Afterwards just open the following URL in your browser: [http://localhost:8080/]


## Maven + Jetty

You need to have [Maven] installed - then simply run the following goal:

    mvn jetty:run

Again you're able to see the results when opening [http://localhost:8080/] in your browser.
